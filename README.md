# Development Process

At the beginning, I went through the JSON structure of a Sneaker object. Based on my observations,
I assumed that the price of a sneaker remains constant across all genders, sizes, and colors.

Initially, I created two data classes, namely Sneaker and CartItem.
Here, CartItem has information about a Sneaker and the quantity the user intends to add to the cart.

I was thinking to create an additional class for ShoppingCart to hold all cart items,
But as I decided to use ViewModel, to store the cart items within the ViewModel itself.

As there are two data sources: one for displaying sneakers on the home screen and another for
showing cart items.'
To implement abstraction, I created two repositories - SneakerRepository and CartRepository.

SneakerRepository is responsible for returning a list of sneakers sourced from the local JSON file.
And CartRepository gets cart items stored in the RoomDB.
Here, I have also defined the functions for adding, removing, and updating the items in the cart.

To address configuration changes and manage business logic,
I created two ViewModels - SneakersViewModel and CartViewModel.

For navigation, I implemented two bottom tabs: one for displaying available sneakers and another for
showing items added to the cart.

I have used Flow and LiveData to receive updates whenever there are changes.

Additionally, I integrated RoomDB to persistently store cart items in the database.
This ensures that if a user relaunches the app, their cart items will be retrieved from the
database.
